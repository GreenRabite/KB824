Hi, this is one of my first projects I started working on when I first started to learn to code. I wanted to simplify a few things as I got more experience and thought it would be awesome for some others to do and review.

TODO:
* Simplify the functions plotting the data points
* Responsive SVGs for the canvas to work on all screen sizes
* Clean up the d3 functions
* Clean up the text on the main page
* Rewrite the summaries
